# ArtiGround (Artifact Playground)

ArtiGround is an interactive coding environment that combines a chat interface with a live code editor and preview. It leverages Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities to help developers quickly prototype, experiment, and learn various web technologies by generating executable widgets (artifacts) for different web frontend frameworks.

## Features

- 🤖 AI-powered chat interface for coding assistance, powered by LLMs
- 📝 Live code editor with syntax highlighting
- 👁️ Real-time preview of your code, including generated artifacts
- 🗂️ File explorer for managing project files
- 🖥️ Console output for debugging
- 📦 Multiple project templates to choose from
- 💾 Download your project as a zip file
- 📱 Responsive design for both desktop and mobile use

## Technologies Used

- React
- TypeScript
- Material-UI
- Sandpack (for live coding environment)
- Deep Chat (for AI chat interface)
- LLMs (for artifact generation and coding assistance)
